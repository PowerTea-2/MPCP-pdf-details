# 🚀 MPCP - Multi-Port Catch Protocol

[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

A sophisticated privacy-research protocol designed for multi-port communication and event correlation analysis.

---

## 📋 Overview

**MPCP** (Multi-Port Catch Protocol) is a cryptographically-secured protocol featuring:

- **Advanced Event Correlation**: Z-score normalization for timing-window analysis
- **Cryptographic Security**: Built with libsodium
- **Compression Support**: Integrated zstd compression
- **Multi-threaded Architecture**: Optimized for concurrent operations
- **Research-Grade**: Designed for privacy research and educational purposes

**Protocol Specification**: Version 0.5  
**Founding Architect**: PowerTea-2

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

Choose the installation command for your operating system:

#### Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
```bash
sudo dnf install libsodium-devel libzstd-devel
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install libsodium-dev libzstd-dev
```

#### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S libsodium zstd
```

#### openSUSE
```bash
sudo zypper install libsodium-devel libzstd-devel
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)
```bash
brew install libsodium zstd
```

---

## 🔨 Compilation

Compile MPCP with the following command:

```bash
gcc -std=c11 -D_GNU_SOURCE -Wall -Wextra -O2 \ 
    mpcp_fixed.c -o mpcp -lsodium -lzstd -lm -lpthread
```

This will generate the `mpcp` executable with all required libraries linked.
